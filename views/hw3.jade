  p What did you do? Why did it work? What didn't work and why?
  p One method we tried was finding the four corners of the block using those corners to calculate the angle between the lowest, left-most point on the block (see https://github.com/Stefandasbach/vision/tree/trig) . An immediate issue with this method was that our corner calculation was very rough, and depending on the image, not that accurate. Thus, even though we could get an approximate location of the center, it would not be accurate enough. Assuming that the corners were correct, we could get within pi radians of the correct answer. However, because the location of the ‘X’ was not taken into account, the assumed orientation of the block may be wrong. We thus abandoned this method that relied on fuzzy corner calculation.
  p The method we ended up using was filtering certain pixels of the image based on a threshold of RGB values. By doing this, we could get an image of the block in white and everything else in black. From this image, we calculated the centroid of the block by finding the location of the pixels and performing an average on the white pixels. With an estimate of the centroid, our next task was to calculate the angle that the block was at. We treated this as an optimization problem in which we tried to fit a rectangle the size of the block to the true orientation of the block. This was facilitated by fmincon and doing this allowed us to get the orientation of the block. This was a much better technique than the one we initially tried, mainly because through optimization we could remove a lot of the inaccuracy of corner calculations. Since we fit a template of the block to the true orientation, we now had the angle that the block was at, but not necessarily at the correct orientation (again we needed to find the ‘X’). This time, however, since we fit a template to the box we only needed to look at the true image, see how far the true ‘X’ is from the center of the true block, and then use the angle to check both sides of the center to find the location. Thus, we would know when to add pi radians to the angle we got from fitting a template to the block.
  p Estimate the accuracy of your measurements, ideally in MKS units. What aspects of the measurements are likely to be accurate? What aspects of the measurements are likely to be inaccurate?
  p By comparing some of the image’s true angles with our calculated angles, we are within plus minus 0.24 radians from the true angle. Since we treated this as an optimization problem, we only got an estimate of the true location of the block based on some criteria and constraints. Since all our calculations were based on the assumed orientation and location of the block, our angle calculation is accurate relative to the assumed location. It is very hard to verify the accuracy of the centroid calculation, since the true centroid is unknown.
  p What is the effect of the missing (0) depth values?
  p We did not use depth to localize the block. However, if we were to, then we would have an issue with noise. The 0s act as noise when filtering the image based on depth, and if there is a large amount of 0s near the block, then our calculation of the center of the block would be much more difficult since the filtered image we produce would be very noisy.
